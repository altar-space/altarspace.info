            altar holds sacred the spirit of mutual care and support. 
            <br><br>
            in recognising the significance of art, music, collective making, dreaming and witnessing, 
            it is vital to acknowledge the Sovereign Owners of the land, sky and waterway which look over us—-
            the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung and Bunurong Boon Wurrung peoples of the Eastern Kulin Nation. 
            we pay our respect to Elders past and present and, through them, to the vision and collective resilience of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.
            <br><br>
            altar also acknowledges our community members, and our respective ancestors who have shaped our journeys to this time and place. 
            we are grateful for your recognition, and continue to tend to the desire paths forged by the strength and unity of our community.
